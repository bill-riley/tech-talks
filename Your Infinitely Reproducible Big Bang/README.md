My principal intent [today|tonight] is to help us better understand how to solve internal problems and external problems, in tangible ways, and distribute that solution.  More concretely: I want to help everyone understand the way information propagates in a culture. The chain of production, the way ideas are designed for accessibility, and the method in which ideas are marketed and distributed. 

For some personal context: I write code for websites, I’m a developer, but I have an artist's mindset when it comes to what I build. When I was young, I was exposed to a great psychologist called Joseph Campbell. He compared religions and other myths and developed an idea called the Monomyth, often referred to as The Hero’s Journey. Fast forward a little bit, and I’m exceptionally sad and frustrated, working at a job I’ve had for a year. I’m basically collecting a check twice a month for clients I morally disagree with.  Driving back and forth, spending and hour and a half in traffic, hating everything and everyone for no reason.  And, I’m trying to figure out how I can fit into this job as an important cog in the machine. 

One day, I’m listening to Mr. Campbell’s talks on Spotify. I ask a silly question: Can I put the journey of the internet into the context of the Monomyth? Maybe if I frame what tech is doing in this context, I can figure out what my place is in this business. 

So, I try it, and it doesn’t work. I model it after Tarot’s major arcana, didn’t work. Deiter Rams’ 10 principals of design, no good. In the end, I do build this framework, uh, "re", build rather.  But the entire, year long process helped me accumulate so many different models before I nailed it. I call the model "Web X.0", and it's what I'm using in my business called Mash the Keyboard and every product it's building, like Hubdia, which is a search engine that focuses on creators. My business and it's products are all ideas, that posit questions, that I'm trying to answer in the best, most accessible way possible. 

Ideas are deceptively simple. My little story I just described is only one example of the process a person's mind takes to help themselves solve *their* internal problem. I've only been actively accumulating for less than a year and a half, Joseph Campbell exclusively accumulated for 5 years, where he had a cabin and simply read. for 4-5 hours every day. 

The best, most accepted ideas are the ones that, once you hear, makes you stand where you are and say, "My god, you're right!" because it "Just Makes Sense," which I posit that "making sense" is **not** an accidental phrase. I'll reference this in the future. 

These are called Intuition Pumps, coined by the American philosoper Daniel Dennett. Intuition Pumps are an idea that was produced from another idea called the Flynn Effect. The Flynn Effect is the argument for why our IQ's have been steadily raising from one generation to the next. The argument says three things, from least actionable to most: 

 - We are becoming more abstract thinkers. 
 - We increasingly take the hypothetical seriously. 
 - We create and consume models to understand our complex world. 

Here’s the human tie that I care about: Your IQ correlates to how accepting of other people you are. That’s exactly what The Flynn Effect says when we say "we take the hypothetical seriously." We, as a culture, can better empathize because we can imagine being black, or gay, or trans, or anything else you're not. 

So, the most accessible way I can put this: eat ideas, become nicer.

That's the process of producing an idea. The next step is designing the product. If you can wrap your idea into a simple sentence, but you can still talk about it for, say, 20 years minimum, you've designed it right. If you can't, keep accumulating. (Accumulating will never, ever stop.)

At this point, you have your product, and you've designed it, now you need to distribute it. This part absolutely **fascinates** me.  Rememeber when I said that an idea has to "make sense"? The process of creating an idea is literally creating sense, and when an idea is distributed to someone else, it "makes sense" in their head too. Once that sense the idea created is distributed to everyone in a culture, that sense obviously becomes the most commonly distributed form of sense. We often refer to this phenomenon as "Common Sense".
