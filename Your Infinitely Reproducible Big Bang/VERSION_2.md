# Your Infinitely Reproducable Supernova
## Storyline
Plot out how ideas are formulated, the fundamental relationship between ideas, and illustrate the concept that ideas are dots. You accumulate dots through collaboration and research, you can smash dots together to create new dots, and this is a process that is endlessly reproducible. 

## Intuition pump
You need to accumulate ideas, bad and good, to innovate. 

## Talk
The title of this is Your Infinitely Reproducible Supernova, and since my own personal fascination is in ideas, their vitality, solving problems, and keeping my mind as fresh as possible for those few functions, as is all of ours I would hope, I think I could share at least one considerate path to accomplishing those few goals. 

To start off, I want to ask a question: What process helps you filter all of the information that you consume every day? It's an interesting thing to ask, it's so fundamental. 

Last summer, a picture circulated on Facebook and Twitter that illustrated the relationship between ideas, and connecting them.
